# Computer Vision RPS
Rock-paper-scissor RPS is a game in which players show one of the three hand gestures simultaneously, representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera. 

## Milestone 1
* A Github repository is created to track changes and save code online

## Milestone 2
* this code created a computer vision in which the model detecs wether the user is showing rock, paper or scissors to the camera. 
* the model was created using a technology called Teachable Machine where different classes are made to represent the rock, paper or scissor.
* to train each class to represent the RPS a lot of pictures were takes in different angles to make the outcome more accurate.

## Milestone 3
